    <h4>WHY IS GUN CONTROL NEEDED</h4>
<p >Hello my name is Suprem Lama, I am 19 years old. I graduated from Newtown High School and now I am majoring Animation in BMCC. Today I want to talk about gun control. One reason why I want to talk about this is because people die every day in this world because of gun violence, robbery, internet trash talk and other. This is one of the main social problems because many people own guns and most of the guns people own aren't registered. They buy guns illegally. Most of the people buy guns illegally so that if they kill someone the police won't catch them. </p>
    <p>Buying guns illegally helps them to run away from that situation. Some people buy guns to harm themselves, some do it to harm others and only some buy guns for their own safty. </p>
    <p>If gun control was forced by the government there will be less % of people dying. This is one of the main topics I really wanted to talk about because we were only born with one life and one family. Once you die you will never come back to life and you will lose your family. </p>
    <p>The world would be a better place if there was no such thing as guns, wars or violence. 90% of the people who attempt sucide with a gun die and this is not a thing to be proud about. Even a person under the age of 18 can buy illegally a gun and when they do they only think about doing one thing: Suicide because they are getting bullied by their friends or they are depressed.</p> 
    <p> With gun control we should also raise awarness about bullying or cyber bullying. In America according to a few websites 22,303 americas above the age of 18+ died in 2016 with a gun. This is only the people who are 18 plus now if we have to count the amount of death happening all around the world in a year by gun voilence, suicide and other it would be more than 100 thousand.With gun control being forced we will only have few % of people dying each year and we will save a lot of people's lives.</p> <p> Gun control might already be a thing but is is doing nothing, people are still dying every day with guns and if we don't do something about it we will lose more lives. To make this happen we all citizens have to stand together and tell our government to force this law. A person's life is not something to joke about. The biggest influencers have to raise awarness about it.</p>
